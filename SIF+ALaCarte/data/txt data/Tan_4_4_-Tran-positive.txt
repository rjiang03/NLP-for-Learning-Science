Tan 4-4S4: Like, the wind field would be like, um, 6 Newtons per meter squared, for this, for, for the .5 one. And for the 1.0 one it would be the same thing. And for the 2.0 it would be the same thing.S3: Oh, if you divide it.S4: They'd all be six. Yeah. So, all'd be like the same field.S3: Right.S4: So I'm guessing it would be a larger force, because it's a larger bead. So it would be a larger cross-sectional area, so it has to be a larger force so that the electric field can be the same. That's what I think. I don't know.S3: Oh. I hadn't thought of that. But I think it's saying like, I think it's saying, is it feeling more electric effect because there's more overall force or is it because there's more per area. You know what I mean? That's like, large electric force, meaning each charge is greater, or does it feel more electric effect because there's more charges, because there's more area, do you know what I mean? I think it's asking that. Ah. Mmm. I don't know, what do you guys think? I have no idea.S1: When I first heard it, I thought it was like what you said about charges, and that is probably electric field. Because each charge doesn't have like a different amount of force.S3: Does that make sense? I know like you were trying to relate the concepts.S4: Yeah, but like if you look at like, if you look at the next question-S3: Uh-huh.S4: -it asks about the same electric effect. So when would that be? Wouldn't it be electric field is the same? Cause it says, "think of wind," as the hint, so I would guess that it would be the same electric field.S3: So you're saying it would work for electric field or are you saying it should be for, it should be the electric force?S4: I would say it would have a larger electric force and the same electric field as the smaller bead. So both beads would have the same electric field but the larger bead would have a-S3: The greater, larger.S4: -force.
