S2: Does the fact that the force [inaudible] would make the fan, I mean it would make the kite accelerate more?
S1: It’s just that it’s a larger kite, so like, I mean, it’s like-
S3: Gonna feel more force.
S1: Yeah, it’s got, it’s got, if I had a fan blowing, like say it was an infinitely large fan blowing just however much wind, if I had a kite, you know, one kite that was small, like this big, it’s, it can only get this much force. But if I had a big kite it’s going to get all that force.
S4: No. No it’s not.
S1: Yes it is.
S4: No it’s not. 
S1: Yes it is.
S4: Okay. 
S2: Mmmm.
S1: Why, why do you say not, though, actually?
S4: No, now you don’t get to hear my opinion.
S1: What?
S4: Sorry.
S1: No, go ahead. 
S4: It’s like the car and the truck thing from last semester. They feel the same force.
S1: Right, cause I was here last semester.
S4: It’s the problem that everybody has in physics. If, if the car runs into a car and the car runs into a truck, which one feels a bigger force. You think the car because the car-
S2: Is smaller.
S4: - is smaller and reacts more. But they actually feel the same force. The force just affects the truck less.
S1: It’s getting the same like, like let’s see how it’s… It’s saying, “in what sense is the wind stronger” though. It’s saying “in what sense.” 
S3: [inaudible] 
S2: [inaudible] 
S1: It’s like, it’s the same amount of force coming, but because there’s more area to collect that force, the wind is stronger on that kite. It’s not asking specifically for the force.
S2: It’s like the [inaudible] with the bowling ball and the golf ball. Remember, we like talked about drag last semester, where it didn’t care like how big or small, it still put the same force on it.
S3: Yeah.
