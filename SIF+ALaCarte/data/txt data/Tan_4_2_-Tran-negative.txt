Tan 4-2S3: We're kind of stuck.TA: Okay. I've come to help. So where are you? Twenty-one. Somebody's got to-S4: Five?TA: Five? Okay. So it says, [reading] "let's think about the better definition of the wind field from question 7. What are the units of that number?" Um, well you've got, it seems, reasonable units here. Newtons per meter squared. So is that, you were just not sure about that, or?S3: Yeah, we're not sure if we're getting along the right...TA: Oh, well I've been checking. I think you guys are- S3: Oh, okay.TA: moving along the right track.S4: And another thing, what, what do they mean by better definition, cause this looks good enough.TA: Oh, I think. Well, you're supposed to-S3: Choose one.TA: -pick one. Yeah, so there's two there, so you picked two. So I think that's maybe the better definition.S4: Oh, okay.TA: So you've already, you've picked out the better one, I think was the idea. Um, yeah, so this, as far as kind of accomplishing what you were doing up here, which was converting how much area you have into the force that that feels. And this is a set of units for your wind field definition that will work. It's kind of a conversion factor between area and force.S4: Mm-hmm.S3: Okay.TA: It seems like you're not satisfied with what you, what you, what you've done so far, or?S3: I am, but I'm trying to. I'm trying to to still understand what wind field is. Because, let's see.TA: It's just, it's a way to convert between these two concepts. So the wind field says, you give me an area-S3: Uh-huh.TA: - multiply it by the wind field, and I'll tell you the force at that point.S3: Okay.TA: And so it's just this concept that allows you to convert between these two ideas-S3: Okay.TA: - that given an area there is a corresponding force that it would feel for this particular wind field.S3: Okay. All right, that helps. Thank you.	TA: Yeah, if you have any other questions, just let me know.S3: Okay.
