Tan 4-1S4: Well, if it's Newton per meter squared, then wouldn't this be the right one?S2: Would it?S1: Yeah, it's just Newtons, right?S4: That's what I thought, but I don't know if it's Newtons per meters squared.S2: Oh.S3: Wait, for wind? Oh, right. Unless, were you thinking of wind force as Newtons per meter squared, [writing] per meter squared, or just Newtons?S2: I just thought it was Newtons.S4: I guess, um-S3: No, so, uh.S4: Would that, it, so I guess.S3: The second definition would be better? Are we going to still say both?S4: Is it Newtons per meter squared or is it Newton meter squared? Do we know this?S2: I think the second one is Newton meters squared.S4: No, the second one is Newtons per meter squared and the first one is Newton-S3: Just Newtons.S4: - meters, Newton meters squared.S3: Oh, oh, oh. Newtons times meters squared?S4: Yeah.S3: Right. Cause force is just Newtons.S4: Yeah. So. I guess I don't really know which one it is. [Inaudible]S3: Mmm, that's tough. I think we have to decide one definition. Not both. Well, wind field... It's talking about one point, right? So, if we use this definition, then it would be force over a whole area, whereas this would be force over one point. You know what I'm saying?S1: Mm-hmm.S3: So wo- do you think the second definition? Would work better?S4: Yeah, probably.S3: I mean, I don't know, that's just an idea.
