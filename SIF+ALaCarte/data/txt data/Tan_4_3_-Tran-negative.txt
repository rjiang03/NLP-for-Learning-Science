Tan 4-3TA: So, you guys want to tell me a little bit about your ideas, about what this first part was all about?S2: Um...TA: What did you think of it?S3: Well, we agreed that the second definition works.TA: Mm-hmm.S3: The wind force divided by cross-sectional area.TA: Okay. So what does that mean?	S3: Uh... That gives you the amount of force that's applied at one point, over that area.TA: Okay.S3: Like, cause, cause you're dividing that force by the whole area. You, I'm repeating what the definition is, but.TA: So, how did you get that? S3: Um, I guess, first, up here, we basically divided the given amount of force over the area and then multiplied that by the greater area to find the amount of wind force on the larger area.TA: So, you could just think about what happens there. You have a fan-S3: Uh-huh.TA: -that's blowing, right? And then you have a kite that sits in front of the fan.S3: Uh-huh.TA: So, I guess the question was, if you put a larger kite, would that, would the kite feel anything different? What do you think?S4: It would feel it, like if you put a larger kite it would feel a larger force.TA: Okay.S4: Because it has a larger, um, cross-sectional area.TA: Okay.S4: So.TA: So, so the idea is that the force that the, that an object would feel...S4: Is dependent on the cross-sectional area.TA: Right. In the case of the wind. So it's depending on-S3: Okay.TA: -on the property of the object.
