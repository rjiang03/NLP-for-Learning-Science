Tan 3-2S4: So for part A, it should be yes, right?S3: I don't know about electric charge. Cause...S4: Oh.S3: I don't know.S4: Oh, okay, no.S3: Electric change and heat, is that... I don't know.S4: I mean, it should be no, because when we charged this, the charge went off. So there's no point, like, if you went with your hands it's gonna lift.S5: But in order to like neutralize a charge, don't you have a charge yourself? Like if that has negative charge, then you'll need a positive charge to neutralize it?S3: Mmmm. S4: Yeah.S3: That's a good point.S4: But, but I don't think we could create a charge, you know?S5: I don't-S1: This is fri-, like, this is like friction.S4: That's-S1: That, that creates static.S4: It creates heat, but I don't think it like, I don't think it could like create electricity.S5: I think you need to rub it. Because if you rub the two styrofoam plates together, I don't think it would create a charge. It's like rubbing it against the same charge. S3: Ohhhh.S1: Right.S5: You need to like, you know how you rub your feet against like a carpet and you can create a charge?S3: Oh, okay.S4: No. S5: I think you need like opposite charges.S3: Opposite.S1: So, rubbing your two hands together, no. But rubbing your hands with someone else's?S5: Someone else's? But don't we all have the same charge?S1: Do we?S5: I don't know. Let's try it.S1: I'm doing all the work.S4: No. S3: [inaudible] S4: So, because of opposite charges? Or is it the same charge?S3: Yeah, we don't have an electric change when we rub hands together because we have the same charge rubbing up against each other.S5: No.S3: If we use different materials, there's different charges, so.
