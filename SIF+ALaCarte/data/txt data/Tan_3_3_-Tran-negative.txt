Tan 3-3TA: Did you guys go through the second part?S4: Yeah.S5: Yeah.TA: So what did you find? What did you think? S5: Um, that if you rub two of the same materials together-TA: Mm-hmm.S5: -you can create a charge.TA: Right.S5: Um, why, is that? Is that because they're like, is it because they're both neutral? Or is it because they both have the same charge? Why?TA: Well, what do you think?S5: Those two things.TA: Maybe, any of them. Did you try anything else? I mean- S5: We tried the styrofoam.TA: Did it work?S5: No.TA: No. Okay. Did you try the tape?S1: Two tapes together?TA: Mm-hmm.S1: No.S5: Uh-uh.S5: Is that in three, I think it's in three. It's part three.TA: Okay. No, I think it was here.S5: Oh, we only got to part two.TA: Oh, sorry. Uh, yeah, you didn't have put the two tapes together, but, um, okay. So you tried the two styrofoam plates, you tried your hands. Did you try anything else?S1, S5: No.TA: But when you, did you try to rub the styrofoam plates with something else, like the piece of cloth? S5: Mm-hmm.TA: And that worked.S5: Mm-hmm.TA: Did you try your hand with the piece of cloth?S5: I did, yeah. It didn't work.TA: It didn't work, right. So, what, do you see any differences or any similarities?S5: Um.TA: So you saw that the hands didn't work when they were the same, right? Okay, and the styrofoam plates...S5: Didn't.TA:  Didn't work because they was the same. But I mean, but, that, uh, that's one possibility. Did you [inaudible] that possibility?S5: Like you rub.TA: So that is, yeah, that is what you found. And-S5: Mm-hmm. No, but I just want to know why-TA: Why that happened.S5: Uh-huh.. TA: Because they are the same material. When you charge an object, how do you charge it? What did you find in the previous part? S1: You rub it  with something else.TA: Rubbing with something else. Because they are two different materials and the charge may want to stay on that material or maybe when you, when you just rub it, it wants to go from one material to the other. But if you had the same material, there is no...S3: No need for it to go.S1: Oh, no need to move.TA: Yeah, yeah.S5: Oh.TA: Does that make sense?S3: Mm-hmm.TA: So what happens when you uncharge an object? What-S5: Um, the charge moves to something else.TA: Right. So what did you use to uncharge?S5: You use your hands.TA: Can you use something else?S5: Um.TA: Can you use a styrofoam plate?S5: We didn't try, did we?S3: Metal.S5: You can use metal. We didn't try the styrofoam plate, though.TA: But do you think it would work?S5: No.TA: Why do you think that?S5: Cause it'd charge it up.TA: It, it's easy to charge, it's easy to charge, it's easy to charge it. S5: Yeah.TA: So, some materials can be charged, some materials cannot be charged. Right? Yeah. Okay.S3: Thank you.
